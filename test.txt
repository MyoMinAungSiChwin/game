Review Environment

Submission ID: 9a8d686e-7485-4770-9afc-855bc02a5ef1
Review date: June 09, 2025
Version reviewed: 1.0

Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata
Issue Description

Majority of the screenshots only display a splash screen. Screenshots should highlight the app's core concept to help users understand the appâ€™s functionality and value.

Next Steps

Upload new screenshots that resolve the issues identified above and accurately reflect the app in use on each of the supported devices.

Note some screenshots may only be viewed and updated by selecting "View All Sizes in Media Manager" in the Previews and Screenshots section of App Store Connect.

Resources

Follow these general requirements when adding or updating screenshots:

- Marketing or promotional materials that do not reflect the UI of the app are not appropriate for screenshots.
- The majority of the screenshots should highlight the app's main features and functionality. Note that splash and login screens are generally not considered to show your app in use.
- Confirm that the screenshots appear identical to the app in all languages and on all supported devices. For example, screenshots can include the controls, interface or menus present in the app.
- Make sure that the screenshots show the app in use on the correct device. For example, iPhone screenshots should show the app as it appears on iPhone, not on iPad. Screenshots of the app on multiple Apple platforms can be included to demonstrate compatibility.

Guideline 2.1 - Performance
Issue Description

The app crashed during review. Apps that crash negatively impact users.

Specifically, your app crashed when we tapped on Take Photo or Video button.

Review device details:

- Device type: iPad Air (5th generation)
- OS version: iPadOS 18.5

Next Steps

Test the app on supported devices to identify crashes and stability issues before resubmitting for review. Crash logs have been attached to help resolve this issue:

1. Fully symbolicate the crash report. See Adding Identifiable Symbol Names to a Crash Report.
2. Match the crash report to a common pattern. Based on the pattern, take specific actions to further investigate the crash. See Identifying the Cause of Common Crashes.
3. Once the root causes of the crash have been identified, make the appropriate changes to the binary to resolve the issue.
4. Test the app on a device to ensure that it runs as expected.
Guideline 2.3.10 - Performance - Accurate Metadata
Issue Description

The app or metadata includes information about third-party platforms that may not be relevant for App Store users, who are focused on experiences offered by the app itself.

Next Steps

Revise the app's binary to remove non-iOS device images.
